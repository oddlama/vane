Right clicking a tiny slime with a bucket puts it in there. It remains quiet, but will start jumping inside the bucket if you find yourself in a slime chunk.
The slime can also be deployed back into the world by right clicking on a block. You may use it as a replacement for slimeballs. You monster.
